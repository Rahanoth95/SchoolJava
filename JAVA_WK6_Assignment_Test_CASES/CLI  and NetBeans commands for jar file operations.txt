Using CLI
To create a jar file
del *.class
del *.jar
javac Assert.java Reservation.java
jar -cvf w6.jar Assert.class Reservation.class
jar tvf w6.jar
javap w6.jar Reservation
javap w6.jar Assert


To compile and execute a single file (TestReservation.java) with w6.jar 
(using only java not javac and including *.java extension)
(does not leave a *.class in current directory)
java -cp w6.jar TestReservation.java 


or


i)
first, using the jar xvf command,  extract the contents of the provided w6.jar file (in the attached Assignment-Resources-W6.zip file) into the current directory. The contents of the w6.jar file are the Reservation.class, the Assert.classs, and the META-INF folder. 

ii)
Then, using the javac command,  compile your test file (e.g., TestReservation.java) also in the current directory. 

iii)
Finally, using the java command, you execute the main() method of your test file. 

These commands are as follows:

jar xvf w6.jar
javac TestReservation.java
java TestReservation
